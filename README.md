📌Project Description
Ever wanted to know what the weather is like in a city and catch a glimpse of its most iconic historic places — all at once?  
That's exactly what Weather & Historic Places Explorer 🌦️ is all about.

This project started as a fun experiment to blend real-time weather data with beautiful city visuals. You type in a city name, and instantly see:

- 🌤️ Current weather (temperature, humidity, wind, condition)
- 🖼️ A stunning background image of a famous landmark from that city

Whether you're a developer brushing up on frontend skills, a traveler planning your next trip, or just someone who loves weather apps — this project offers a little something for everyone.

Built with **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5**, and powered by **JavaScript + jQuery**, it fetches data using the **WeatherAPI**. It’s clean, simple, responsive, and very extendable.

💡 Why I built this
I wanted to go beyond plain text-based weather data and create an interface that *feels alive* — where each city doesn’t just tell you the forecast but also shows you a glimpse of its soul*.

🚀 What’s next?
- 📍 Add geolocation support so it auto-detects your city
- 🌙 Dark mode toggle for night owls
- 📅 Multi-day weather forecast
- 🗺️ Interactive maps or tourist info integration

Thanks for checking it out! 😊
